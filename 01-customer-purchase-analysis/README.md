# DAX Problem & Solution –01- Customer Purchase Analysis

This repository contains a Power BI case study focused on solving key customer analytics problems using DAX functions such as `ADDCOLUMNS`, `SUMMARIZE`, and `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`.




---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following tables:

- `Customer`  
- `Product`  
- `Region`  
- `Sales`  

These tables are related appropriately in the Power BI data model to perform sales and customer analysis.

## 🧠 DAX Problems to Solve

Using **`ADDCOLUMNS`** and **`SUMMARIZE`**, solve the following:

1. **Customers with Only One Purchase**  
   What is the count of customers who made just one purchase?

2. **Churned Customers**  
   How many customers did not return this year?

3. **New Customers in Current Year**  
   How many customers made their first purchase in the current year?

4. **Repeat Customers**  
   What is the number of customers who purchased more than once?

5. **Average Products per Sale**  
   What is the average number of products purchased per transaction?

6. **Re-solve All of the Above using `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`**  
   Implement the same logic using `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS` instead of `ADDCOLUMNS`/`SUMMARIZE`.
