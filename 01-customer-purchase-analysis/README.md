##  Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following tables:

- `Customer`  
- `Product`  
- `Region`

This visual represents the Power BI data model used in this case study. It illustrates the relationships between the key tables: Customer, Product, Region, and Sales.

‚û°Ô∏è The Sales table serves as the central fact table, containing transaction-level data.

‚û°Ô∏è It connects to the Customer, Product, and Region tables via one-to-many relationships, enabling efficient filtering and aggregation.

‚û°Ô∏è This star schema design supports optimal DAX performance and simplifies complex analytical calculations.

‚û°Ô∏è The well-structured data model ensures accurate and efficient customer purchase analysis using DAX measures and calculated tables.

##  DAX Problems to Solve

Using **`ADDCOLUMNS`** and **`SUMMARIZE`**, solve the following:

## ‚ùì01 - Customer Purchase Analysis

This section focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using DAX in Power BI. Below are the key sub-questions explored in this analysis:

1. **Customers with Only One Purchase**  
   > What is the count of customers who made just one purchase?

2. **Churned Customers**  
   > How many customers did not return in the current year?

3. **New Customers in the Current Year**  
   > How many customers made their **first-ever** purchase in the current year?

4. **Repeat Customers (Year-over-Year)**  
   > What is the number of customers who made purchases in **both** the current year and the previous year?

5. **Average Products per Sale**  
   > What is the average number of products purchased per transaction?

6. **Re-solve All of the Above Using `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS`**  
   > Re-implement the above calculations using the `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS` function  
   > (instead of `SUMMARIZE` or `ADDCOLUMNS`) to improve performance or clarity.
