Analyze the total number of subjects each student has **passed**, with dynamic behavior based on filters ‚Äî such as whether a single subject or all subjects are selected ‚Äî using DAX in Power BI.

---

## üìÅ Dataset Table

This analysis uses a single table:

- `ExamResult`

### üìÑ ExamResult Table Columns:
| Column        | Description                           |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `StudentName` | Name of the student                    |
| `Subject`     | Name of the subject                    |
| `Result`      | Result of the exam (`Pass` or `Fail`)  |

## üîó Relationships

_No relationships are required for this specific analysis, as all data is within a single table._

## ‚ùì What Are We Solving?

This DAX challenge explores how to **count the number of passed subjects per student**, while intelligently handling situations where the data may or may not be filtered down to a single subject.

### üîπ Problem 21: Count of Subjects Passed by Each Student

**Objective:**  
Display the **total number of subjects that each student has passed**. The measure should adapt dynamically based on filters ‚Äî for example, whether a single subject is selected or not.

This helps when building reports that display both subject-level and overall student performance, depending on slicers or visual context.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 21A: Using `HASONEVALUE`

```dax
Answer21_Count_hasonevalue = 
IF (
    HASONEVALUE ( ExamResult[Subject] ),
    SELECTEDVALUE ( ExamResult[Result] ),
    COUNTROWS (
        FILTER ( ExamResult, ExamResult[Result] = "Pass" )
    )
)
```
## ‚úÖ Solution 21B: Using ISINSCOPE (Same Logic, Different Function)

```dax
Answer21_Explanation_Count_Isinscope = 
IF (
    ISINSCOPE ( ExamResult[Subject] ),  // Check if 'ExamResult[Subject]' is in the current filter context
    SELECTEDVALUE ( ExamResult[Result] ),  // Return the result for that subject
    COUNTROWS (
        FILTER ( ExamResult, ExamResult[Result] = "Pass" )  // Count how many subjects are passed
    )
)

```
## Explanation:

Both versions solve the same logic using different functions:

HASONEVALUE checks whether there‚Äôs exactly one value in the current context.

ISINSCOPE checks if a column is present in the current grouping/filter context ‚Äî ideal for visuals like matrix or tables.

These are useful for building adaptive DAX measures that behave differently based on the filter or visual context.
